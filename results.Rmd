## Overall Trend

![](figures/fig1_water_distribution.png)  
The density plot shows that the overall distribution of daily water intake is 
highly right-skewed, with most adults consuming between 0–5,000 grams per day. 
Importantly, the curves for individuals with and without diabetes nearly 
overlap. This suggests that there is no obvious unadjusted difference in water 
consumption between diabetes groups.

A scatter plot with smoothed curves shows contrasting patterns between diabetes 
groups.

- For non-diabetic adults, HbA1c remains stable across the water-intake range 
with no apparent trend.
- For adults with diabetes, the curve initially slopes downward but rises again 
at very high consumption values.

The large uncertainty at extreme water intake levels is due to very small sample 
sizes, which prompted a methodological change: instead of modeling water as a 
continuous predictor only, we created water-intake quartiles to stabilize 
estimation and facilitate interpretation. 

## Regression Model

We developed three logistic regression models, from unadjusted to 
demographics-adjusted and fully adjusted, with water quartiles as the main 
exposure to model diabetes status.

Across the model evolution, there is no emergence of a protective association. 
If anything, estimates remain near null or slightly above 1, suggesting no 
evidence that higher water intake reduces diabetes odds.

Fully adjusted beta coefficients and odds ratios for Q2–Q4 vs Q1 are shown 
below.

- All odds ratios are close to 1.0, with 95% confidence intervals crossing 1.
- The P for trend from m3_trend is not significant.

- All estimates are very close to 0, and confidence intervals include 0.
- The trend test is non-significant in the fully adjusted model.

Across unadjusted, demographics-only, and fully adjusted models, we consistently see no
meaningful difference in HbA1c by water-intake quartile.

## Sensitivity Analysis

In both models, the per-100 g effect was extremely small and not statistically
significant, consistent with the quartile-based results and confirming that 
treating water as continuous does not reveal a hidden dose–response association.
