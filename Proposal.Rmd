**Tentative Project Title:** Association Between Water Intake and Diabetes Outcomes in US Adults: A Cross-Sectional Study Using NHANES data

**Project Motivation**

Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) is a common chronic condition which can seriously threaten people’s health. Diets and lifestyle are very important for the disease management. We found that existing research more focus on the complex diet pattern like sugar or sweeten relative intake. Water consumption is one of the most basic, easily change, and low-cost daily behaviors. But systematic research in this area is lacking.

**Intended Final Products**

1. GitHub repository containing all analysis code and reports.
2. The website presenting our research background, methods, results and conclusions.
3. A short YouTube video.

**Anticipated Data Sources**

National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2021-2023 cycle. We utilized Demographic, Dietary, Examination, Laboratory, and Questionnaire data files.

**Planned Analyses**

_Exposure:_ Total Water Intake (Water_g). Data were collected from Dietary interview, Total Nutrient Intakes First Day.

_Outcome:_We will use dual-validation: Type 2 Diabetes Status (Diabetes): A binary variable (1=Yes, 0=No) based on doctor diagnosis. Glycohemoglobin (HbA1c): A continuous biomarker (%) reflecting long-term glycemic control.

_Covariates:_ Age (Age), Gender (Gender), Race/Ethnicity (Race), Education Level (Education), Family Income-to-Poverty Ratio (Income_PIR). Body Mass Index (BMI), Smoking History (Smoking). Total Energy Intake (Energy_kcal), Total Sugar Intake (Sugar_g).

1. _Descriptive Statistics and Bivariate Analyses:_ We need to test for statistically significant differences in baseline characteristics across the water consumption. Use t-test in continuous variables and chi-square test in categorical variables.

2. _Multivariable Risk Models:_ Use Multivariable Logistic Regression to estimate Odds Ratios for the risk of having diabetes. And Multivariable Linear Regression will be used to estimate Beta Coefficients for the association with HbA1c levels.

3. _Sensitivity Analyses:_ We will categorize Total water consumption into 4 groups, Q1-Q4. And we will do ANOVA and Chi-square.

**Planned Timeline**

11.7-11.14 get data and do analyses part1 11.15-11.22 finish the rest of the analyses. 11.22-11.29 writing report and website. 11.30-12.6 peer review and record video.
