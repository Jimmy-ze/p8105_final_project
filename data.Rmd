## NHANES 2021–2023

We use data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 
a nationally representative study of U.S. residents that combines interviews, 
physical examinations, and laboratory measurements. We obtained public-use files 
for the 2021–2023 cycle and integrated demographic, dietary, examination, 
laboratory and questionnaire components to build our analytic data set for this 
project.

After data cleaning and processing, the cleaned data set includes 
`r scales::comma(nrow(df))` observations and `r ncol(df)` variables.

## Key Variables

<span class="var-badge">Water_g</span>: Total water intake (grams) from 24-hour 
dietary recall (Day 1); primary exposure, analyzed continuously and in 
quantiles.

<span class="var-badge">Diabetes</span>: Clinician-diagnosed diabetes status 
(binary; 1 = yes, 0 = no).

<span class="var-badge">HbA1c</span>: Glycohemoglobin (%); continuous secondary 
outcome reflecting long-term glycemic control.

## Core Covariates

<span class="var-badge">Age</span>: Participant age in years.

<span class="var-badge">Gender</span>: Male / Female.

<span class="var-badge">Race</span>: Categories for race/ethnicity.

<span class="var-badge">Education</span>: Highest education level completed.

<span class="var-badge">Income_PIR</span>: Income-to-poverty ratio (PIR), a 
continuous indicator of social and economic status.

<span class="var-badge">BMI</span>: Body mass index (kg/m²).

<span class="var-badge">Smoking</span>: Smoking history/status (binary).

<span class="var-badge">Energy_kcal</span>: Total energy intake (kcal/day) from 
the same 24-hour recall.

<span class="var-badge">Sugar_g</span>: Total sugar intake (grams/day) from the 
same 24-hour recall.

## Data Quality Notes

- We align dietary, lab and exam records by participant ID and recall day, and 
prefer Day-1 intakes for comparability.

- For categorical fields (e.g., education, race/ethnicity, smoking), we apply 
factor labels.

- Observations with missing value in data is excluded.

- Sensitivity analyses consider water intake in quantiles (Q1–Q4) to assess 
potential non-linearity.
