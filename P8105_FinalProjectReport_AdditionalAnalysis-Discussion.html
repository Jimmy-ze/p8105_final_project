<h2>Additional Analysis</h2>
<p><strong>1. Logistic Regression: Water Intake and Diabetes
Status</strong> To determine whether water intake was independently
associated with diabetes prevalence, we fitted three nested logistic
regression models using water-intake quartiles (Q1–Q4) as the primary
exposure. Model 1 was unadjusted; Model 2 adjusted for demographic and
socioeconomic characteristics; and Model 3 further adjusted for BMI,
smoking history, and dietary factors including total energy and sugar
intake. As shown in the crude prevalence comparison (Figure 6), diabetes
prevalence differed minimally across quartiles, and this pattern carried
through in the adjusted models.</p>
<p>Across all three models, the estimated odds ratios for Q2–Q4 relative
to Q1 remained close to 1.0, and most confidence intervals crossed the
null. In the fully adjusted model, the highest quartile displayed a
modestly elevated odds ratio (OR = 1.61; 95% CI: 1.17–2.21), but this
effect did not align with trends observed in unadjusted analyses or
exploratory visualizations. The corresponding forest plot (Figure 4)
illustrates the minimal and inconsistent magnitude of associations.
Although the trend test reached statistical significance (p = 0.005),
the inconsistencies across models and the small effect size reinforce
the conclusion that higher water intake is not associated with reduced
diabetes risk.</p>
<p><strong>2. Linear Regression: Water Intake and HbA1c</strong> We next
examined whether water intake was associated with HbA1c, a clinical
measure of long-term glycemic control. The same adjusted modeling
strategy was used. In unadjusted analyses, higher water intake appeared
weakly associated with lower HbA1c, consistent with the modest
differences shown in the quartile means (Figure 7), but this pattern
reversed after adjustment.</p>
<p>In the fully adjusted model, the differences across water-intake
quartiles were minimal. Compared with Q1, Q4 exhibited a small positive
association (β = 0.105; 95% CI: 0.002–0.209). While statistically
significant at the 0.05 level, the effect size was extremely small and
far below thresholds considered clinically meaningful. The trend test
was marginal (p = 0.056), further indicating a lack of robust
dose–response association. This finding is visually consistent with the
continuous relationship shown in (Figure 3) and the adjusted
β-coefficient forest plot (Figure 5).</p>
<p><strong>3. Sensitivity Analysis: Water Intake as a Continuous
Exposure</strong> To ensure that the quartile-based approach did not
obscure possible linear or nonlinear relationships, we repeated the
analyses using water intake as a continuous variable. Effect estimates
were scaled to reflect a 100-gram increase in daily water
consumption.</p>
<p>Both the logistic and linear sensitivity models produced extremely
small coefficients. A 100-gram increase was associated with a 1.1%
increase in diabetes odds and a 0.004-point increase in HbA1c—changes
that are negligible both statistically and clinically. Even a 1-liter
increase in water intake (approximately 1000 g) translated to only
trivial changes in either outcome. These findings confirm the continuous
patterns observed in (Figure 3) and align with the low correlations
illustrated in the heatmap (Figure 8).</p>
<p><strong>4. Stratified and Descriptive Analyses</strong> We also
explored whether the water–diabetes relationship differed across BMI
categories. Stratified boxplots (Figure 9) and ANOVA tests indicated no
meaningful variation among normal-weight or obese individuals. A small
statistical difference was observed among overweight individuals, but
the magnitude of the effect was minimal and inconsistent with patterns
in other strata. Similar null patterns emerged when comparing crude
diabetes prevalence and mean HbA1c values across water-intake quartiles,
as confidence intervals substantially overlapped across all groups.</p>
<p><strong>5. Correlation Structure</strong> Additionally, a correlation
analysis (Figure 8) revealed that water intake exhibited very weak
correlations with age, BMI, energy intake, sugar consumption, and HbA1c
(|r| &lt; 0.1 for all variables). This low degree of correlation
suggests that multicollinearity does not affect model stability and that
water intake offers little predictive value for diabetes-related
outcomes relative to other variables.</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>This project evaluated whether daily water intake is associated with
diabetes status or glycemic control among U.S. adults using NHANES
2021–2023 data. Across all analytic approaches—including descriptive
statistics, fully adjusted regression models, continuous-exposure
sensitivity tests, and stratified evaluations—the results consistently
demonstrated that water intake is not meaningfully associated with
either diabetes prevalence or HbA1c levels.</p>
<p>The initial descriptive analyses revealed substantial overlap in the
distribution of water intake between adults with and without diabetes.
HbA1c values were also similar across water-intake quartiles, with only
minor differences that lacked clinical or statistical importance. These
findings were reinforced by the regression analyses: after adjusting for
demographic, socioeconomic, lifestyle, and dietary factors, the
association between water intake and both diabetes outcomes was minimal.
Although a small, statistically significant positive association
appeared in the highest intake quartile in fully adjusted models, the
effect was small, inconsistent across analyses, and likely attributable
to residual confounding or reverse causation. For example, individuals
living with diabetes may increase their water consumption due to
increased thirst, a common symptom of hyperglycemia.</p>
<p>The sensitivity analyses, which treated water intake as a continuous
variable, further confirmed the absence of a meaningful relationship.
Even large differences in daily water consumption corresponded to
negligible changes in diabetes odds or HbA1c levels. Stratified analyses
by BMI category similarly failed to reveal any consistent or
interpretable effect modification.</p>
<p>Taken together, these results suggest that daily water intake, as
measured by 24-hour dietary recall in NHANES, does not substantively
influence diabetes status or long-term glycemic control. While hydration
remains important for general health and physiological function, the
evidence from this nationally representative dataset does not support
the hypothesis that increasing daily water consumption reduces diabetes
risk or improves glycemic outcomes. Factors such as age, adiposity,
dietary quality, and socioeconomic status appear to play far more
substantial roles in shaping diabetes risk.</p>
<p>This study’s strengths include the use of high-quality national data,
clinically measured biomarkers, rigorous multivariable adjustment, and
multiple complementary analytic strategies. However, several limitations
warrant consideration. The cross-sectional design of NHANES precludes
causal inference. Daily water intake is self-reported and may be prone
to measurement error, and single-day dietary recall may not accurately
reflect habitual hydration patterns. Furthermore, potential confounders
such as physical activity, medication use, and kidney function were not
included in the final models.</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, the evidence consistently indicates that
higher water intake is not associated with improved glycemic outcomes in
U.S. adults. Future research may benefit from incorporating longitudinal
hydration patterns, objective hydration biomarkers, or physiological
measures of fluid balance to further clarify the role of hydration in
chronic disease risk.</p>
