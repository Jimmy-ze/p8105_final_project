## Data Cleaning and Processing

First, numerical variables were converted to numeric type to prevent 
factor-related computation errors. Second, observations with missing values in 
key variables were removed using na.omit(). Third, the categorical variables are
recoded:

<span class="var-badge">Gender</span>: 1 = Male, 0 = Female

<span class="var-badge">Smoking</span>: 1 = Smoked ≥100 cigarettes, 0 = Never 
smoked

<span class="var-badge">Diabetes</span>: 1 = Diagnosed, 0 = Not diagnosed

<span class="var-badge">Race</span>: 1 = Mexican American, 2 = Other Hispanic, 3 
= Non-Hispanic White 4=Non-Hispanic Black

<span class="var-badge">Education</span>: scale 1-5, from “<9th grade” to 
“College graduate or above.”

<span class="var-badge">Water_Q</span>: Q1 corresponds to participants in the 
lowest 25% of daily water intake (lowest hydration group), Q2 and Q3 represent 
the middle 50% of water consumers, and Q4 corresponds to the highest 25% of 
daily water intake (highest hydration group).

## Exploratory Analysis

We examined the distribution of water consumption across diabetes groups, 
assessed potential confounders, and visualized early associations between 
hydration and metabolic health. The overall process include discovering overall 
trend, model examination, sensitivity analysis and stratified visual checks.

## Primary Models

To model diabetes status, we fit a sequence of logistic regression models with 
water quartiles as the main exposure:

## Sensitivity Analysis

To check robustness, we reanalyzed water as a continuous variable:
