## Data Cleaning and Processing

First, numerical variables were converted to numeric type to prevent 
factor-related computation errors. Second, observations with missing values in 
key variables were removed using na.omit(). Third, the categorical variables are
recoded:

<span class="var-badge">Gender</span>: 1 = Male, 0 = Female
Smoking: 1 = Smoked ≥100 cigarettes, 0 = Never smoked
Diabetes: 1 = Diagnosed, 0 = Not diagnosed
Race: 1 = Mexican American, 2= Other Hispanic, 3= Non-Hispanic White 4=Non-Hispanic Black
Education: scale 1-5, from “<9th grade” to “College graduate or above.”
Water: Q1 corresponds to participants in the lowest 25% of daily water intake (lowest hydration
group), Q2 and Q3 represent the middle 50% of water consumers, and Q4 corresponds to the
highest 25% of daily water intake (highest hydration group).
